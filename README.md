This project is an improved version of a tool designed to automate the process of posting Instagram content to Twitter. It allows you to select a specific Instagram post from a user's profile based on the post's date and then upload it to Twitter. This project was created to streamline the content sharing process for the society "KCL Womxn in STEM," where I am the Co-Vice President in charge of Social Media and Communications.
